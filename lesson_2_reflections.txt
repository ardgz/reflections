What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It will create a git repository out of your current directory. This will allow
you to be able to commit your files so that you can start saving different
states of your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
respository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains files that have a logical change made and 
are prepared to go into an immediate future commit. The working directory
contains files that are incomplete and a repository contains all files of
a single project. The staging area provides the value of containing only
files that are connected by a single logical change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

I would only add my files to the staging area if that file contains a logical
change I have made and will only add more files if their logical changes
are the same or related.
