When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository when I'm working on a programming project from
multiple computers and/or with multiple people. This is so that all files and
commits are stored in one main repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

We should always pull changes manually because when we work on files from
a repository, we should be able to add our changes to our files and pull
changes from the remote repository only when we want to. If Git
automatically pulls updates from the remote repository regularly, it would
interrupt our workflow and our files can be changed at anytime while we are
editing them. This would cause confusion on what was changes were made and
whether we made them or someone else did. It's kind of like working on a 
drawing and all of a sudden other people decide to draw on it while we are
working on it or without our approval.
